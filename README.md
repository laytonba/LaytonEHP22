# LaytonEHP22
R code and ddPCR data used in Layton et al., Environmental Health Perspectives (2022).  https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP10289


Download and run the script ddPCR_dataPrep_EHP.R to popluate your Rstudio workspace with the ddPCR data that were used in this publication, including our QC flags and aggregated summary tables. 

I also have R code for creating the micro-sewershed map figures (Figs. 1A, 4, & 5), but need to confirm with all parties that those shape files are OK to share publicly in order for that code to run and re-create our figures. Please contact me at LaytonB@CleanWaterServices.org if you have any questions. Thank you!
